// Given a string s containing three types of brackets {}, () and []. Determine whether the Expression are balanced or not.
// An expression is balanced if each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket of the same type, the pairs are properly ordered and no bracket closes before its matching opening bracket.

// Balanced: "[()()]{}" → every opening bracket is closed in the correct order.
// Not balanced: "([{]})" → the ']' closes before the matching '{' is closed, breaking the nesting rule.
