// The "Move Zeroes" problem is a common Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) question that asks you to rearrange an array so all zeros are at the end, while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements, and doing so in-place (without using extra space). 
// Input: [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
// Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
